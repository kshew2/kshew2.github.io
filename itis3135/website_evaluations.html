        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <h3>Bad Example: <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.htm" target="_blank">SpaceJam.com</a> </h3>
        <p>This is the webiste for the original space jam movie. There are a few bad things going on in here. It feels as if this website was created by a young student without much design
            experience but is trying to learn.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The contrast is not very good its hard to read the red text against the white stars on the background.</li>
            <li>Repitition: Some of the formatting is the same like the stars and red text on some icon links, and then some are just completely random layouts with also hard to read contrast.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The alignment is pretty decent on this page actually all but one of the pages has good alignment, but there is also not much content to them.</li>
            <li>Proximity: The proximity is also not terrible but some pages just have a bit of spacing.</li>
        </ul>        

        <h3>Good example: <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="blank">Airbnb.com</a></h3>
        <p>Airbnb is a online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The website is very simple and makes it easy to book your next stay.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The contrast is well on the eyes. Its simple but it seems they have done good research as the colors work well together.</li>
            <li>Repitition: The website keeps the same theme across all of its internal links.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The alignment is symetrical for the most part there are some parts that have images so its a different type alignment but it still fits nicely.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Everything is the appropriate distance from its counterparts and things of similar catagories.</li>
        </ul>
